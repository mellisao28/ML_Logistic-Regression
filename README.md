# ML_Logistic-Regression
a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university based on historical data from previous applicants that can be used as a training set for logistic regression.
Part 1: Plotting the data
Part 2: Compute Cost and Gradient at initial theta (zero)
Part 3: Optimizing theta using fminunc
Part 4: Predict and Accuracies
e.g. predict the probability that a student with score 45 on exam 1 and score 85 on exam 2 will be admitted.
